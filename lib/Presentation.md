# Class Presentation Outline

This document outlines the presentation due on Wednesday, November 4th, 2020.

## 1- App Description

Have you ever been to an event where food was served, and you, or someone you know, had a hard time finding food that they like or that fits their dietary needs?

Well, the solution is **My Food Choices!**

**My Food Choices** is a simple tool for users to store their dietary restrictions to share with event organizers for any event where food is served!

It has an interface for users to enter their dietary choices, and another for admin (event organizers/food servers) to view the needs of the entire list of guests.
