Have you ever been to an event where food was served, and you, or someone you know, had a hard time finding food that they like or that fits their dietary needs?

Well, the solution is **My Food Choices!**

**My Food Choices** is a simple tool for users to store their dietary restrictions to share with event organizers for any event where food is served!
