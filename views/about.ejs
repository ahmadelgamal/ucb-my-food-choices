        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          Ever been to an event where food was served, and you, or someone you
          know, had a hard time finding food that they like or that fits their
          dietary needs?
        </p>
        <p>Well, the solution is My Food Choices!</p>
        <p>
          My Food Choices is a simple tool for users to store their dietary
          restrictions to share with event organizers for any event where food
          is served!
        </p>
        <p>
          It has an interface for users to enter their dietary choices, and
          another for event organizers/food servers to view the needs of the
          entire list of guests.
